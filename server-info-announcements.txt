[IMPORTANT NOTICE] Recently, Cloaked has stopped responding to my messages after I showed him evidence of his abuse of admin privledges on the server. I feel it is necessary that you all know that this is happening and that by joining the server, you are accepting of these actions. He has stated multiple times that he has not been using admin. According to the logs, he has used commands to give himself a total of 1350 levels of exp, 192 blocks of lapiz, 32 blocks of diamonds, 48 stacking upgrades (worth 384 blocks of diamond, gold and iron), and other stuff such as a speed controller. He has also used commands to summon multiple villagers into his base. This is the stuff I can see, however he has also gone into creative 25 times for a total of 52 minutes. What he does or gets out of creative I cannot see. He has also recovered his stuff multiple times in spectator. None of this evidence includes the time he spent doing actual admin stuff like giving back stuff, building spawn, etc. He justified his actions by calling it "testing" when I confronted him. He never removed these items nor did he kill self. I do not appreciate liars and especially those who double down on them. I spent over 16 hours making this pack and helping him set up the server while he played games. All for him to not even give me the decency of responding. For that I will no longer be apart of this server anymore. It was a pleasure meeting yall. My deepest apologies to the anonymous donator for writing this message. I hope Cloaked will apologize as well. If you wish to see the evidence for yourself, dm me.
