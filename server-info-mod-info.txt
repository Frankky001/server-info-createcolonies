This will only give you info on the main mods.

- JEI 
  This mod is the bases to find out everything you need to know. Opening your inventory brings a paged list of all the items in the game on the right with a search bar. There you can search for any item as well as the items from any mod. To do this type the @ symbol folloed by the name of the mod. It does not have to be the full name. Ie; @create will show all items from Create as well as any Create addition mod that's name starts with Create or "Metallurgy" which will show all items from Create: Metallurgy.
Left click on any item to see its recipe and Right click to see what other recipes the item is needed for. JEI also has a feature that allows you to add a item you dont have to a Create mod item filter by dragging it from JEI into the filter (the filter slots should turn green if the item is compatible)

- **Create**

  With Create you can automate the production of almost everything in a intuitive and simple way. Most blocks with Create and its additions have a feature to let you view in JEI what their function and uses are. This can be done by holding W on any item that allows you to "Ponder" it. The best way to start with this mod is just watching as many ponders as you can.

  Notable Create Additions
      - Create: Metallurgy overhauls the ore smelting process. This is more complicated so use JEI and right click each item in the process starting with the raw ore. Notable things you may miss while doing this are, you dont need a blaze burner only a basic burner if you dont have a blaze burner, you can use a millstone instead of crushing wheels, you dont not need to wash the dirty dust if you dont want to, and a casting basin is the simplest way of cooling your liquid metals. 

      - Create: Enchantment Industry adds new ways of obtaining enchanted books. The most notable feature of this mod is duplicating enchanted books with the Printer item. This mod also allows you to store exp in tanks.

      - Create: Ore Excavation
Adds ore veins to the game which can be drilled infinetly with up to 4 drilling machines in each vein chunk. These drilling machines take a ton of stress units and are difficult to set up. Check out the gold farm as a guide. To find a vein use the ore vein finder.

      - Create: Diesel Generators adds a new way to make power by pumping out oil and refining it to make fuels to be used in different types of engines.

      - Create: Big Cannons adds cannons. These can be hard to set up. The best place to start is by pondering the cannon mount block.

      - Create: Creating Space adds space. This is also hard to do and there are very few ponders sooooo yea google. You can ponder the rocket engines to start. 

      - Create: Food adds a shit ton of food

      - Create: Crafts and Additions adds a couple things. Most notably electricity and a straw that you can use a blaze burner to allow you to pump liquid fuels directly into the burner. 

      - Create: Broken Bad pretty fucking obvious what this adds lmao

- Create: Numismatics. This adds the currency system. It adds multiple blocks relating to selling, saving and using money. It is themed around create so the coins are modeled after cogwheels. More info on the currency itself is in the "Currency Info" page. Notable blocks are the bank terminal which allows you to store and take money out of it. The vendor allows you to set up shop (shift + rclick). You can select whether to buy or sell a certain item as well as select the price and what you are selling/buying. In the bottom right slow is where you put what you're selling/buying. Putting multiple in there means how many you are selling/buying at a time. In the other 9 slots is how much stock you have. Items can be put in automatically with funnels/chutes/hoppers if in selling mode, and items can be taken out automatically when set to buying. 

- Valkyrien Skies is a physics engine that can give your creations physics. Physics means a build that will fall out of the sky and tumble around. However, this also means you can place blocks on this thing as its falling rather than it being just a entity. (This is hopefully just temporary until Create: Aeronautics releases (if ever) which is much less laggy and buggy while providing more capability and simplicity.) Dont expect a release for a couple months at least.
    
      - Create: Interactive allows you to turn the regular create contraptions into physics object if you wish. Notably trains. If you want the contraption to have physics, you must place the InteractMe block (yes its pink and black) within your glue before assembling. This can be done with anything that uses the create contraption system like trains, mechanical bearing spinny farms as well as minecart contraptions. Do use this sparringly as it does create lag the more physics objects there are. Would recommend using it on trains if you have like chests, beds, crafting tables, chairs or other interactable objects on your trains. 
    
      - CLockwork adds wings and flaps to control flying objects but it also adds the way to turn a regular block build into a physics object. To do this you must highlight the area (kind of like glue or a schematic) with a Physics Wand and then place this wand in a Physics Infuser. If you are making a vehicle, it can be hard to stabilize it. Check out the gyro for this or use the next mod.

      - Eureka is another way to make physics object. A ship/airship can be made with eureka's helm block. This is much more simple way and doesnt require you to select anything. It will detect what you want to be a ship which can be buggy so best is to build it not attached to anything else. You can use this helm to steer and move your ship but it will be slow af. This helm can also be used just to stabilize. You can then use your own steering mechanism and propulsion to move faster while being stabilized. If you start using the helm the ship will slow down and the propulsion will be useless relagating you to the speed of the helm.
   
      - Trackwork adds wheels and tank tracks with suspension. Ponder the wheel and tracks.

- **Minecolonies** this is the second major mod besides Create. THis mod is similar to Lego Fortnite and COC. This mod allows you to create entire colonies with the help of slaves or colonists however you see them. You can tell them to make buildings and then you supply the materials. They can have many jobs to gather resources and process them. To get started place a Supply camp or just a town hall with a builders tool. Find the townhall and builders tool in one of the storage blocks in the camp and place the townhall building (Under fundamentals). Somebody should spawn at ur townhall block and give you a tutorial. A tip for this mod is to place your buildings according to how big they look at level 5 as you will upgrade them.

- Open PAC adds a way to claim chunks so people dont steal. To claim a chunk open the map and right click the chunk/chunks you want to claim. You can hold right click as well to select multiple. You can also forceload (chunk loader) chunks the same way. Limit is currently 10 chunks.

- Computer Craft. This is the last important mod and I have no idea how to use it. It has insane potential for controlling cool machines using create or valkyrien skies but you have to know how to code in Lua. I doubt anyone will ever use this but if yk how to code then shit ur god basically. 

- Alex's Mobs and Alex's Caves. I know very little about these mods but AMobs adds Mobs and some bosses. Alex Caves is the only one that adds good gear i believe. Start with the Animal Dictionary for AMobs. To start ACaves get a few cave tablets (no idea how) a copendium, and a spellunkery table.

- L'Enders Cataclysm adds bosses and gear. Also no idea how to get started here. Probably craft some eyes to find bosses. search for @cataclysm in JEI

- Etched allows you to play any mp3 file you want. The best way to do this is record a mp3 file using audacity or download one (dont get a virus) and then past it into discord. You need a direct download link and discord is easiest to do that (i think). Then copy the link (not message link) and paste it in a radio or etching table with a blank music disc and music label to create a custom music disc. 

- Immersive melodies adds instruments to play many different songs. You can give certain mobs a instrument or other palyers and it will sync with one another.
